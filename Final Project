Below is the final project from Charlotte Chaze's course. This one is largely free form - I come up with which queries I'd like to create and answer,
based on a provided database. That database's file name is chinook. Charlotte laid out the tables, columns, and relations in this image:

On to the SQL!

I've created something like 15-20 queries for this music sales data set. For the ease of the reader, I'm placing the queries I find to be most 
complex at the top. Simpler queries, like 'count of invoices for x year', will be toward the end.


COMPLEX QUERIES

Who are the top selling artists in California, USA?
    select r.name as artist, sum(i.quantity) as total, v.billingstate, v.billingcountry
    from invoices v, invoice_items i, tracks t, albums a, artists r
    where v.billingstate = 'CA'
    and v.invoiceid = i.invoiceid
    and i.trackid = t.trackid
    and t.albumid = a.albumid
    and a.artistid = r.artistid
    group by r.name
    order by total desc limit 5;

    and v.invoiceid = i.invoiceid
    and i.trackid = t.trackid
    and t.albumid = a.albumid
    and a.artistid = r.artistid

    and i.invoiceid = v.invoiceid
    and v.customerid = c.customerid
    and track = "The Trooper" 
    order by c.lastname;

How many invoices exist with a track purchased from an artist with "The" in their name?
(I realize this specific query would almost never be useful/insightful, but searching for almost any other word could be.)
Curiously, and understandably, using '%the%', '%the %' and '% the %' yielded different results - 80, 77, and 55 rows, respectively.
    select name, title, albumid
    from albums a, artists r
    where title like '%the%'
    and a.artistid = r.artistid
    order by r.name;

What is the name of the top selling employee by quantity?
    select e.lastname, e.firstname, sum(i.quantity) as quantity
    from invoices v, invoice_items i, employees e, customers c
    where i.invoiceid = v.invoiceid
    and v.customerid = c.customerid
    and e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
    group by e.lastname
    order by quantity desc;

What is the name of the top selling employee by invoice count?
    select e.lastname, e.firstname, count (v.invoiceid) as count
    from invoices v, invoice_items i, employees e, customers c
    where i.invoiceid = v.invoiceid
    and v.customerid = c.customerid
    and e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
    group by e.lastname
    order by quantity desc;
    
Which customers and countries bought the top-sold song?
    select t.name as track, c.lastname, c.firstname, c.company, c.country, v.total
    from tracks t, invoice_items i, invoices v, customers c
    where t.trackid = i.trackid
    and i.invoiceid = v.invoiceid
    and v.customerid = c.customerid
    and track = 'The Trooper'
    order by v.total desc;

Which tracks (by ID) have not sold?
    select trackid
    from tracks
    except
    select trackid
    from invoice_items;
    [1,519 results]
