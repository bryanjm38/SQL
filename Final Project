Below is the final project from Charlotte Chaze's course. This one is largely free form - I come up with which queries I'd like to create and answer,
based on a provided database. That database's file name is chinook. Charlotte laid out the tables, columns, and relations in this image:

On to the SQL!

I've created something like 15-20 queries for this music sales data set. For the ease of the reader, I'm placing up top the queries I find to be most complex.
Queries like 'count of invoices for x year' will be toward the end.

COMPLEX QUERIES






LESS COMPLEX QUERIES

How many genres exist in the database?
    select count(distinct genreid)
    from tracks;
    
What is the length of all available playlists and their names and playlist ID?
    select p.playlistid, p.name, count(t.trackid) as length
    from playlist_track t, playlists p
    where t.playlistid = p.playlistid
    group by p.name;
    
What is the length of each album? (Showing albumid, artist, album, and length)
    select a.albumid, r.name as artist, a.title as album, count(t.trackid) as length
    from albums a, artists r, tracks t
    where t.albumid = a.albumid
    and a.artistid = r.artistid
    group by a.albumid
    order by artist;
