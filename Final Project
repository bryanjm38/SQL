Below is the final project from Charlotte Chaze's course. This one is largely free form - I come up with which queries I'd like to create and answer,
based on a provided database. That database's file name is chinook. Charlotte laid out the tables, columns, and relations in this image:

On to the SQL!

I've created something like 15-20 queries for this music sales data set. For the ease of the reader, I'm placing up top the queries I find to be most complex.
Queries like 'count of invoices for x year' will be toward the end.

COMPLEX QUERIES

How many genres exist in the database?
    select count(distinct genreid)
    from tracks;

What is the top-selling genre?
    select g.name, count(i.quantity) as TracksSold
    from genres g, tracks t, invoice_items i
    where g.genreid = t.genreid
    and t.trackid = i.trackid
    group by g.name
    order by TracksSold desc limit 1;
    
What is the least-selling genre?
    select g.name, count(i.quantity) as TracksSold
    from genres g, tracks t, invoice_items i
    where g.genreid = t.genreid
    and t.trackid = i.trackid
    group by g.name
    order by TracksSold asc limit 1;
    
What is the length of all available playlists and their names and playlist ID?
    select p.playlistid, p.name, count(t.trackid) as length
    from playlist_track t, playlists p
    where t.playlistid = p.playlistid
    group by p.name;
    
What is the length of each album? (Showing albumid, artist, album, and length)
    select a.albumid, r.name as artist, a.title as album, count(t.trackid) as length
    from albums a, artists r, tracks t
    where t.albumid = a.albumid
    and a.artistid = r.artistid
    group by a.albumid
    order by artist;
    
How many countries have purchased tracks?
    select count (distinct billingcountry)
    from invoices;

What are the top five countries by sales?
    select v.billingcountry, sum(i.quantity) as total
    from invoices v, invoice_items i
    where v.invoiceid = i.invoiceid
    group by  v.billingcountry
    order by total desc limit 5;

What are the top 5 songs sold?
    select t.name as track, count (i.trackid) as sales
    from tracks t, invoice_items i
    where t.trackid = i.trackid
    group by track
    order by sales desc limit 5;

Whhich customers bought the top selling song?
    select t.name as track, i.quantity, c.customerid, c.firstname, c.lastname, c.company
    from tracks t, invoice_items i, invoices v, customers c
    where t.trackid = i.trackid
    and i.invoiceid = v.invoiceid
    and v.customerid = c.customerid
    and track = "The Trooper" 
    order by c.lastname;

Which customers and countries bought the top 5 songs sold?
    

What is the top selling track, artist, & country, outside the United States?
    select t.name as track, r.name as artist, count (i.trackid) as sales, v.billingcountry
    from tracks t, invoice_items i, invoices v, albums a, artists r
    where t.trackid = i.trackid
    and i.invoiceid = v.invoiceid
    and t.albumid = a.albumid
    and a.artistid = r.artistid
    and billingcountry != "USA"
    group by track
    order by sales desc limit 6;
    **Six songs all sold four times, so I set the limit to six. Also, the initial single result was a song excitingly called "Untitled" :P
